"Priest: They're a foul breed, part of a satanic order, those black sorcerers."
"They've perpetrated countless killings and murders, castin' a dark shadow over"
"our once peaceful village. Babies, children, and young women, they've been"
"snatched away, taken by these vile creatures. We've discovered the very spots"
"where these beasts revel in their bloody rituals and grotesque feasts."

# WIld-basic

Text based RPG game, written in Qbasic for MS-DOS. This is my very first project on GitHub. I'm trying to understand how open source code works and see if there's still people willing to work on an old-school text-based RPG project just for fun.

I'd be very glad if you could help with: 

- Music, small sounds effects.
- Transition FXs between the different stages in the game (map, battle, etc.).
- ASCII Graphics.
- A better main menu at the beginning of the game.
- New mechanics and ideas for a better gameplay.
- Ideas for the story.
- Help me with English, making corrections in the different paragraphs and parts of the story if you think they can be written better.
- Help me with the code making it more efficient.
- Any other ideas, suggestions or feedback are welcome.  

Thanks to the contributors:

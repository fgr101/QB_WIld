"As you stroll through the surroundings, a rustling disruption slithers"
"through the stillness, reverberating through your senses. A primal instinct"
"twists your body around, unveiling a colossal Bugio - formidable and violent"
"primate, agrotesque fusion of strength and menace - charging towards you from"
"the shadows."
"****"
"In an adrenaline-fueled surge, your legs thrust into motion, propelling you"
"forward with desperate resolve. Fear clenches your chest, your heart pounding"
"in frantic syncopation as you flee the encroaching horror. Amidst the frantic"
"flight, the weight of your fortunes proves too cumbersome to bear. With each"
"frantic step, your precious gold coins slip from your grasp, abandoned to"
"the mercy of an unforgiving fate."
"****"
"Your breath labors, your muscles burn, but your life is preserved. Yet the"
"echoes of your dashed prosperity haunt your thoughts as your pockets are"
"stripped of their glittering wealth. Your treasure trove reduced to naught"
"but a memory. (Gold = 0)"

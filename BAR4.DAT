"Blonde Woman: There's some sort of magic in this town. Not so big, not too"
"small. If you go out to the streets and look around, the trees, the houses"
"and even the stores look tidy and neat, they are very nice. However, when"
"the sun goes down, people hide in their homes and only come out the next"
"morning. Everyone is terrified of darkness and no one dares to walk out of"
"the city into the  woods. It's very dangerous. Chances of being killed or"
"dissapearing are high."

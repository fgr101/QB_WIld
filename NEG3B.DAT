"As you make your way forward, your eyes catch something in the distance. Just a few" 
"meters ahead, perched delicately on a web, is a brown spider. Its spindly legs quiver" 
"with anticipation, and its eight beady eyes lock onto your presence. A wave of unease" 
"washes over you as you realize the potential danger. The thought of its venomous bite" 
"sends a chill down your spine, and you instinctively take a step back. (-3 HP)"

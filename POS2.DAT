"You find an abandoned house in the place. It's an old house but seems"
"to be in perfect conditions. The front door is open. You get in. The place"
"is clean, there's even a room with a bed, old chairs and a big table. You "
"even find a shelf with many old books. Books about black and white magic,"
"the natural world, about creatures, the kingdom's history, music, poetry"
"and even short stories. You also find some old gold coins around the place."
"You spend the rest of the day resting and reading. Seems to be a safe and "
"good place to spend the night too."

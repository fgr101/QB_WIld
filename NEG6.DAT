"An impending storm looms above, and a sense of unease washes over you."
"The dark clouds gather, swirling with an ominous energy. Desperation grips"
"your heart as you hasten your steps, searching for refuge from the tempest."
"****"
"However, luck eludes you on this fateful day. The heavens unleash their"

"your skin, chilling you to the bone."

"deep into your bones. Shivers wrack your frame as you struggle to ward off"
"the biting chill. Your teeth chatter uncontrollably, and your muscles ache"
"from the strain of pushing forward against the elements. (-1 HP)"
